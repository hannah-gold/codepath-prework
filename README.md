I’d like to build an app called FocusFlow, designed to help students, professionals, and anyone who needs to stay focused while completing a task stay organized and minimize distractions. The app combines task management with mindfulness by allowing users to set focused work sessions using customizable timers, block distracting apps or websites during that period, and track productivity trends over time. A unique feature would be a “focus buddy” option, where two users can sync timers to stay accountable while working remotely. The app would also provide short guided breathing or stretching exercises between sessions to encourage balance and prevent burnout.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
